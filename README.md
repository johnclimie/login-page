# Login Page

## Description

![](./images/screenshot.png)

For Practice I wanted to create a minimal login page, which can be used in the future. I wanted to test my CSS skills with the minimal design and have some fun. I added a gradient background, with the login form in front of it. I also included a default color in the meta for the browser. When the mouse hovers over the login button, it eases into a darker color. I will most likey use this design effort into some future projects with back-end support.
